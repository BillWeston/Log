(/) Install vertex and library file frExposéom Pete's email
( ) Get as much CyWare working as possible while Pete is here, with whatever models.
( ) Plan what I am to do while Pete is away.

Get the little models working chi by eye and hopefully write some asserts, read Tiller on subject
Put in transmission model, in dynolike testbed
put in driveline model, hit run and run away.

Reading about scripting languages and getting confused!
Got SimView working with Morgan's help.

=================
Light is dawning a bit. åé´´´´I want to try the commands in Dymola to see what we are up against.é≈≈x≈Ù

It really makes sense to use a third party glue language.   Not sure Pete is convinced.

==================
Good day for utility stuff, moved Parallels, set up my own login.

====================
Successful runs of CyCLI with Morgan's help
here is good command line:


C:\Users\colin\Development\cymodelica\CyModelica\CyModelicaCommand\target\CyMode
lica\dist>CyCLI -action translateandsimulate CyTransmission.Examples.TorqueConve
rterTest TCTest.h5 -path C:/Users/colin/Development/CyTransmission -path C:/User
s/colin/Development/msl


This works because it uses the -path flag twice, not like my earlier attempts, using working directory.
Note that it only needs to get to msl for the standard library.

$ git status
$ git add
$ git branch
$ git push
$ git clone
$ git checkout
$ git init
$ git log

===================

* Run CyCLI on TorqueConverterTest
* skypetype Morgan about animation - colour based on speed
* Run other things through CyCLI
* commit some git.
* big Dymola play.
* poster for LCO at lunch time.

github URL for CyTRansmission https://github.com/cydesign/CyTransmission

so its just a simple $ git clone https:// etc.  I think.

Right this now lives on the native drive not the vm.

Need to try checking out full CyTransmission.
Try that then do poster proof.
Then definitely switch to coherence.

Can't seem to find the repo for CyCLI.
will do poster.

The CyCLI seems to be part of whole cymodelica.

Friday 25/07/2015
=================
I want to move the sandbox out of the Modelica stuff and recommit.
Check the stuff is where I think it is!

Basically work in Dymola and use the CyCLI as test.
