\section{Friday 25/07/2014  Modelica Day}

Fill in some details for the models in their Modelica documentation, also(?) in the wiki.
If in doubt then {\bf here}.

\subsection{Wet Clutch}
The wet clutch did not work in pedantic because not all components of connectors were connected.\\
Investigate.\\
Fix is ...?
$$ \int_0^{\infty}\exp(-x^2) dx $$

\begin{verbatim}
(defun win-swap ()   "Swap windows using buffer-move.el"   (interactive)     
(if (null (windmove-find-other-window 'right))         
(buf-move-left)       (buf-move-right)))
\end{verbatim}

Can try a git branch and merge.
But upstairs.  Bored with here now after 2+ hours.
Do I take the charger?  Probably, then don't need to come down here in the morning.

\section{Monday 28/07/2014  More Modelica}

There is defintely a bug in Dymola when trying to move between
subcomponent and supercomponent.

\subsection{Investigate torque converter}
It would be nice to be able to save graphical setups in Dymola.
It wouldg be nice if S-f1 S-f2 worked to switch between Modelling and Simulation.

This is how to do the colour dynamically:

       fillColor=DynamicSelect({255,255,255}, if open > 0.5 then {0,255,0} else 
                    {255,255,255}),

in controlled tank system in demos.



Switched to a new branch 'varargin'

\subsection{Make wet clutch test work pedantic}
\subsection{Table for controller}
